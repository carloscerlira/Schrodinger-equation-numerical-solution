# Schrödinger equation numerical solution
The RK4 algorithm was implemented to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation for an arbitrary potential.
# Double slit experiment
The program was tested in a case of interest: the double slit experiment, an interference pattern similar to the one 
observed in the lab experiment was found:

# Documentation
* The main.pdf file contains a brief explanation of the problem and details about the implementation, as well as the 
results obtained for the double slit experiment.  
* In the main.cpp file you can find the program
