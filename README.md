# Schrödinger equation numerical solution
In this project I implemented the RK4 algorithm to solve the Schrödinger equation for an arbitrary potential.
# Double slit experiment
The program was tested in a case of interest: the double slit experiment, an interference pattern similar to the one 
observed in the lab experiment was found:
