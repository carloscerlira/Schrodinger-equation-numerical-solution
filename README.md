# Schrodinger equation numerical solution
In this project I implemented the RK4 algorithm to solve the Schrodinger equation for an arbitrary potential, this is a numerical solution 
# Double slit experiment
The program was tested in a case of interest: the double slit experiment, where the potential is of the form:
```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```
